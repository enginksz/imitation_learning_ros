## Introduction

This project explores the implementation of obstacle avoidance in autonomous systems using imitation learning. The aim is to train agents to navigate environments while effectively avoiding obstacles.

## Technical Overview

### Imitation Learning

- **Definition**: A learning paradigm where agents learn by mimicking expert behaviors.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Behavioral Cloning**: Directly maps observed states to actions.
  - **Inverse Reinforcement Learning**: Derives a reward function from expert behavior.

### Obstacle Avoidance

- **Importance**: Essential for safe navigation in dynamic environments.
- **Methods**: Utilizes sensors (LiDAR, cameras) to perceive and identify obstacles.

## Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)

### Overview

GAIL combines generative adversarial networks with imitation learning to train agents to replicate expert behavior without explicit supervision of actions.

### Key Components

1. **Adversarial Framework**:

   - Involves a generator (the agent) and a discriminator (the expert behavior model).
   - The generator learns to produce behaviors that are indistinguishable from those of the expert, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between expert and generated actions.

2. **Training Process**:

   - The discriminator is trained on expert and generated trajectories, aiming to classify actions correctly.
   - The generator improves its policy based on feedback from the discriminator, striving to mimic expert actions.

3. **Reward Signal**:
   - GAIL derives reward signals from the discriminator's ability to distinguish actions.
   - The agent receives higher rewards for mimicking expert behavior, guiding its learning.

### Applications

GAIL is beneficial in scenarios where defining reward functions is challenging, allowing agents to learn complex behaviors through expert demonstrations.

## Building the Package with Colcon

To build your ROS package, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Package Directory**:
   Open a terminal and change your working directory to the `imitation_learning_ros` folder:
   ```bash
   cd imitation_learning_ros
   colcon build
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

## Running Imitation Learning

Launch the Simulation: Use the following command to launch the Gazebo simulation:

```bash
cd imitation_learning_ros
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch robot_vehicle main.launch.xml
```

Run the Data Collection Script: Use the following command to execute the collect_data.py script:

```bash
ros2 run imitation_learning collect_data.py
```

### Training the Imitation Learning Model

To train the imitation learning model, you will need to run the train_imitation_learning.py script. Follow these steps:

Navigate to Your ROS 2 Workspace: Ensure you are in the root directory of your ROS 2 workspace. If you are in the imitation_learning_ros folder, you may need to go up a level:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

Run the Training Script: Use the following command to execute the train_imitation_learning.py script:

```bash
ros2 run imitation_learning train_imitation_learning.py
```

### Explanation

The train_imitation_learning.py script is responsible for training the agent using the collected data. It typically loads the dataset of state-action pairs gathered during the data collection phase and utilizes algorithms like GAIL or behavioral cloning to optimize the agent's policy.
The training process may involve tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the model's performance based on its ability to mimic expert behaviors.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the training script, check the terminal output for error messages.
Ensure that the collected data is available and correctly formatted.

Example Command Sequence
Hereâ€™s a quick sequence of commands you might use:

```bash
cd ..  # Navigate to the ROS 2 workspace root
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run imitation_learning train_imitation_learning.py
```

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how imitation learning can be effectively utilized for obstacle avoidance in robotics. Future work may involve real-world testing and further model refinement.
